# ai-soccer
Physics based, soccer game sandbox to pit AI agents against each other

## Quick Start
```shell
git clone https://github.com/eparkinson/ai-soccer.git
cd ai-soccer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_game.py
```

This sets up a game between two very basic agents (or 'brains') - DefendersAndAttackers2 and BehindAndTowards

```shell
python test_nographics_game.py
```

This sets up a game without any graphics - perfect for quickly pitting two brains against each other to see the score without having to watch the game visually.

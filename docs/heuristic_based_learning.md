# Heuristic-Based Learning Design

## Overview
Heuristic-Based Learning is a simple and interpretable approach to designing the `LearningBrain`. Instead of relying on complex reinforcement learning techniques, this method uses domain-specific heuristics to guide decision-making and adapt to gameplay over time. This document outlines the design and implementation plan for a heuristic-based `LearningBrain`.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Heuristics
- **Definition**: Simple rules or strategies derived from domain knowledge.
- **Examples**:
  - Move the ball closer to the opponent's goal.
  - Pass to the nearest teammate if under pressure.
  - Prioritize defending the goal when the ball is near the defensive zone.

### 2. Adaptive Parameters
- **Definition**: Parameters within the heuristics that can be adjusted based on game outcomes.
- **Examples**:
  - Aggressiveness in attacking vs. defending.
  - Passing frequency vs. dribbling frequency.

### 3. Feedback Loop
- Use game outcomes (e.g., goals scored, goals conceded) to adjust heuristic parameters.
- Incorporate a reward mechanism to reinforce successful strategies.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Define Heuristics
- Identify key scenarios in the game (e.g., attacking, defending, passing).
- Define simple rules for each scenario.
- Example Heuristics:
  - **Attacking**: Move towards the opponent's goal if the ball is in the attacking zone.
  - **Defending**: Move towards the ball if it is near the defensive zone.
  - **Passing**: Pass to the nearest teammate if surrounded by opponents.

### 2. Introduce Adaptive Parameters
- Add parameters to control the behavior of each heuristic.
- Example Parameters:
  - **Aggressiveness**: Controls the tendency to attack vs. defend.
  - **Passing Threshold**: Determines when to pass vs. dribble.

### 3. Implement Feedback Mechanism
- Track game outcomes (e.g., goals scored, goals conceded).
- Adjust heuristic parameters based on feedback:
  - Increase aggressiveness if scoring is low.
  - Increase defensive focus if conceding is high.

### 4. Integrate with the Game
- Replace the Q-table in the `LearningBrain` with heuristic-based decision-making.
- Use the `on_goal_scored` and `on_goal_conceded` methods to update parameters.

### 5. Test and Refine
- Test the heuristic-based `LearningBrain` in various scenarios.
- Refine heuristics and parameters based on performance.

## Benefits
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and interpret.
- **Efficiency**: Does not require extensive exploration or large amounts of data.
- **Adaptability**: Can adjust to different game scenarios through parameter tuning.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Heuristics**: Use machine learning to discover new heuristics or improve existing ones.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Extend the approach to coordinate multiple players on the same team.
- **Visualization Tools**: Develop tools to visualize heuristic parameters and their impact on gameplay.

## Conclusion
Heuristic-Based Learning offers a practical and interpretable alternative to reinforcement learning for the `LearningBrain`. By leveraging domain knowledge and adaptive parameters, this approach can achieve competitive performance while remaining simple and efficient.
